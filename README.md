1. Scanning script to scan screen pixels and extract the colours into a ```list```. For example: RGB [255, 255, 255]. This is so that I can scan any image I want.
2. Clicking script to iterate through the above generated ```list``` and click based on the colours.

## Sample of images drawn (i usually use images that are simplified in colours already with GIMP image editor)

### 📝 Additional notes
this is done long time ago.
i started developing this as my first python project for fun to learn python too, i did not have any prior knowledge so the codes written are messy and variables are badly named 🙈 <br>
very interesting as I observed it to be like a real life printer 🖨 scanning through every pixel and printing. <br>
my scanning script could set the ```dpi``` through the ```scanrate``` variable, basically how many pixels in a length
